# BPM_Counter
web app that helps users to easily count beats per minute.

Includes a heart that you can tap everytime you feel or hear a heart beat, the timer automatically starts a count down from one minute and will alert the user once its finished and stop you from tappin and counting more beats. Once the timer is over it will also record the time & and list the final beats per min underneath and keep a history.
